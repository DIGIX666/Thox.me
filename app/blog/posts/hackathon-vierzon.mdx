How to transform a paper invoice into a traceable NFT token on blockchain? This question was at the heart of the **Vierzon Blockchain Hackathon** (1st edition) which took place from October 4-6, 2024, where our team developed **ClearCash**, a revolutionary solution for interbank payments.

# 48 Hours to Disrupt Finance

How to make interbank payments instant and transparent? This was the objective of this first blockchain hackathon in Vierzon, organized by **B3 Village by CA**.

Beyond the competition, the event offered technical workshops and conferences with experts like Éric Larchevêque and Guénolé de Cadoudal, allowing us to deepen our blockchain knowledge while developing our solution.

# Our Project: ClearCash (so|cash)

### Our team, composed of:
- **Samy Ayoub**
- **Pierrot Moreno**
- **Zakaria Chaikhi**
- **Myself (Théo Dubois)**

We developed **ClearCash**, a solution built on the **so|cash** protocol. This project focuses on a major innovation in the financial sector: enabling financial institutions to perform instant transactions on the blockchain.

### Key Features

Our **so|cash** solution offers:

- **Invoice issuance as NFTs**: Each invoice becomes a non-fungible token, guaranteeing its uniqueness and traceability
- **Payment tracking and validation via blockchain**: Complete transaction transparency with an immutable history
- **Interbank payment management**: Seamless connection between client and supplier accounts
- **Instant and secure transactions**: Elimination of traditional bank transfer delays
- **Smart contract integration**: Automated account management

# Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack

Our ClearCash solution relies on a modern and robust architecture:

```bash
# Deployment on Avalanche Fuji Testnet
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network fuji
```

**Technologies used:**
- **Solidity**: Secure smart contracts
- **Ethers.js**: Blockchain interaction
- **React.js**: User interface
- **Hardhat**: Development framework
- **OpenZeppelin**: Security libraries
- **Avalanche Fuji**: Testnet for testing

### How NFT-Invoices Work

The core of our innovation lies in transforming traditional invoices into NFT tokens:

```solidity
// Simplified structure of our NFT-Invoice
struct Invoice {
    uint256 id;
    address issuer;
    address client;
    uint256 amount;
    string description;
    InvoiceStatus status;
    uint256 timestamp;
}

enum InvoiceStatus {
    ISSUED,
    PAID,
    CANCELLED
}
```

This approach guarantees:
- **Uniqueness**: Each invoice is a unique token
- **Traceability**: Immutable transaction history
- **Verification**: Automatic payment validation

### Smart Payment Management

Our system automates the complete lifecycle of an invoice:

```solidity
function processPayment(uint256 invoiceId) external payable {
    Invoice storage invoice = invoices[invoiceId];
    require(invoice.status == InvoiceStatus.ISSUED, "Invoice already paid");
    require(msg.value >= invoice.amount, "Insufficient amount");

    // Transfer to supplier account
    payable(invoice.issuer).transfer(invoice.amount);

    // Status update
    invoice.status = InvoiceStatus.PAID;

    emit InvoicePaid(invoiceId, msg.sender, invoice.amount);
}
```

**Technical advantages:**
- **Atomicity**: Payment and update in one transaction
- **Security**: Automatic amount verification
- **Transparency**: Traceable blockchain events

# Technical Challenges Encountered

### Integrating the so|cash Protocol

The biggest challenge was adapting our solution to the so|cash protocol for instant interbank payments. We had to:

```javascript
// Multi-network connection
const networks = {
  fuji: {
    rpc: "https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc",
    chainId: 43113
  },
  socash: {
    rpc: process.env.SOCASH_RPC_URL,
    chainId: process.env.SOCASH_CHAIN_ID
  }
}
```

**Implemented solutions:**
- **Multi-chain compatibility**: Support for multiple blockchain networks
- **Gas optimization**: Reduced transaction costs
- **Real-time synchronization**: Real-time synchronization between banks

### Critical State Management

Ensuring data consistency between the traditional banking system and blockchain:

- **Rollback mechanism**: Rollback mechanism in case of failure
- **State validation**: Cross-validation of states
- **Error handling**: Robust network error handling
